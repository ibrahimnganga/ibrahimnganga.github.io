## Welcome to My Blog!

This is where I share my thoughts and projects.

I am Ibrahim Ng`ang`a, a Cloud and Network Practitioner at Cyart. I previously apprenticed as an Ethical Hacker and Cloud & Network Security professional at CyberShujaa

I graduated from University of Eastern Africa, Baraton in Kenya, with a bachelors degree in Networks and Communications.

In my free time, I like biking my way around trails and hiking for my amazement!


I am best reached through Linkedin. I am always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
